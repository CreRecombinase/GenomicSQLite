# Genomics Extension for SQLite

**("GenomicSQLite")**

This [SQLite3 loadable extension](https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html) adds features to the [ubiquitous](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) embedded RDBMS supporting applications in genome bioinformatics:

* genomic range indexing for overlap queries & joins
* streaming storage compression (also available [standalone](https://github.com/mlin/sqlite_zstd_vfs))
* pre-tuned settings for "big data"

Notice: this project is not associated with the SQLite developers.

## Under construction

![build](https://github.com/mlin/GenomicSQLite/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=main)

The extension isn't quite ready for general use. The repo is public to facilitate "soft launch" preparations.
